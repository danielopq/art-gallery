## Overview

Developed a fully responsive frontend for an art gallery website, tailored to deliver a seamless experience across a variety of devices. I utilized the mix-blend-mode CSS property to create visually appealing blending effects, adding depth and artistry to the design. To ensure fluid layout transitions, I implemented CSS Grid templates, optimizing content flow and alignment for desktops, tablets, and mobile screens. Each elementâ€™s position and styling were meticulously crafted to match the provided design mockups, ensuring an accurate and visually engaging representation.

This project was built from the ground up using only HTML and CSS, without relying on frameworks, to maintain complete control over the codebase and optimize for performance.

## My process

I initially developed the website with a focus on the desktop version, ensuring all elements were positioned accurately and fully aligned with the specified design requirements. Once the desktop layout was finalized and approved, I adapted the website for tablet and mobile devices by incorporating responsive design principles using CSS media queries. This approach allowed me to efficiently adjust layouts, font sizes, and interactive elements to provide an optimal user experience on smaller screens without altering the original HTML structure.
