## Overview

Developed a fully responsive frontend for an art gallery website, designed to deliver a seamless experience across a variety of devices. To achieve fluid layout transitions, I implemented CSS Grid templates, optimizing content flow and alignment for desktops, tablets, and mobile screens. Each element's position and style were meticulously crafted to align with the provided design mockups, ensuring an accurate visual representation.

This project was built from the ground up using HTML, and CSS, without relying on frameworks, to maintain complete control over the codebase and optimize performance.

## My process

I initially developed the website with a focus on the desktop version, ensuring all elements were positioned accurately and fully aligned with the specified design requirements. Once the desktop layout was finalized and approved, I adapted the website for tablet and mobile devices by incorporating responsive design principles using CSS media queries. This approach allowed me to efficiently adjust layouts, font sizes, and interactive elements to provide an optimal user experience on smaller screens without altering the original HTML structure.
